# NeoPixel Controller System

A sophisticated distributed LED art installation system using M5StickC Plus2 microcontrollers to create synchronized light shows across multiple nodes. Each node controls 334 WS2812B NeoPixel LEDs with advanced networking, audio reactivity, and individual user control.

## Current Status: Version 1.1.22 (Latest Development)

**Last Updated**: August 2025  
**Active Nodes**: ~10 devices (OTA system restored and working)  
**Network**: Works with or without WiFi (ESP-NOW mesh priority)  
**Recent Focus**: **NEW FEATURE:** Smooth pattern crossfading + OTA system restoration

## ðŸ†• Recent Major Improvements (v1.1.22)

### âœ… Smooth Pattern Crossfading
- **3-second crossfade transitions** between patterns instead of abrupt changes
- **Dual pattern rendering** - both old and new patterns run simultaneously during transition
- **Ease-in-out blending curve** for professional-quality visual transitions
- **Music reactivity preserved** during crossfade periods
- **Synchronized across all nodes** - leader controls crossfade timing

### âœ… OTA System Restoration
- **Simplified v56-style OTA** - removed complex mode management that was causing failures
- **ESP-NOW conflict resolution** - proper shutdown sequence during OTA uploads
- **Reliable wireless updates** - tested and working across all nodes
- **Partition corruption recovery** - full flash erase capability for corrupted devices
- **Authentication working** - "neopixel123" password system functional

## System Architecture

### Hardware Configuration
- **Controllers**: M5StickC Plus2 ESP32 devices
- **LEDs**: 334 WS2812B NeoPixels per node (`NUM_LEDS = 334`)
- **Communication**: ESP-NOW for pattern synchronization + WiFi for OTA updates
- **Audio**: Built-in microphone for beat detection and music reactivity
- **Power**: Each node independently powered
- **Network**: Multi-WiFi support (Barn, GMA-WIFI_Access_Point, phone hotspot)

### Distributed Leadership Model
- **AUTO Mode**: Nodes automatically elect a leader using MAC-based token algorithm
- **Leader Node**: Generates patterns, detects audio, broadcasts synchronized data at full brightness
- **Follower Nodes**: Receive and display leader's patterns with perfect synchronization
- **Automatic Failover**: If leader goes offline, remaining nodes elect new leader
- **Conflict Resolution**: Higher MAC-based tokens automatically become leader
- **Offline Operation**: ESP-NOW mesh works perfectly without WiFi

### Individual Brightness Control
- **Local Control**: Each node controls its own brightness independently
- **6 Brightness Levels**: 6%, 12%, 25% (default), 50%, 75%, 100%
- **Music Synchronization**: Leader's audio reactivity baked into LED colors, then each node applies local brightness
- **OFF Mode**: Complete sleep with dimmed display for battery savings

## User Interface

### Button Controls
- **Button A Short Press**: Cycle through brightness levels (LOCAL 6% â†’ 12% â†’ 25% â†’ 50% â†’ 75% â†’ 100%)
- **Button A Long Press (2s)**: Enter/exit OFF mode (auto-syncs on wake)
- **Button B**: Pattern freeze/advance (only works when node is leader)
- **Button C**: Manual sync reset (force resynchronization with other nodes)

### LCD Display
- **Color-coded Status**: Orange (Leader), Green (Follower), Purple (Election), Black (OFF)
- **Brightness Display**: Shows current local brightness level (e.g., "LOCAL 50%")
- **Pattern Info**: Current pattern name or "Following Leader"
- **Connection Status**: ".236" (WiFi IP) or "LOCAL" (offline mode) in bottom right
- **Version Display**: "v1.1.x" in bottom left corner
- **Freeze Indicator**: [F] shown when patterns are frozen

## Pattern System

### 22 LED Patterns
**Basic**: Rainbow, Chase, Juggle, Rainbow+Glitter, Confetti, BPM, Fire, Color Wheel, Random  
**Advanced**: Pulse Wave, Meteor Shower, Color Spiral, Plasma Field, Sparkle Storm, Aurora Waves  
**Organic**: Organic Flow, Wave Collapse, Color Drift, Liquid Rainbow, Sine Breath, Fractal Noise, Rainbow Strobe

### Pattern Generation
- **Leader Only**: Generates patterns with audio reactivity baked into LED colors
- **Music Mode**: When audio detected, `effectMusic()` scales LED colors by `musicLevel` (dramatic nearly-off to full-bright response)
- **Background Mode**: Normal patterns when no audio detected
- **Extended Timing**: Automatic pattern cycling every 15 seconds (3x longer than original 5 seconds)
- **âœ… NEW: Crossfade System**: 3-second smooth transitions between patterns with both patterns running simultaneously
- **Full Brightness Broadcast**: Leader sends 100% brightness data, each node applies local scaling

## Audio Reactivity

### Music Detection (Leader Only)
- **BPM Analysis**: 5-second rolling window for beat detection
- **Threshold Detection**: `musicLevel > 0.6f` triggers beat events
- **Adaptive Levels**: Moving averages for sound min/max provide full dynamic range
- **Synchronized Response**: All nodes react identically to leader's audio analysis

### Implementation
- **Color Scaling**: Music reactivity applied via `leds[i].nscale8(musicScale)` in `effectMusic()`
- **Network Distribution**: Music-scaled colors transmitted at full brightness
- **Local Brightness**: Each node applies its brightness percentage to received data
- **Dramatic Response**: Audio scaling ranges from ~12% (quiet) to 100% (loud beats)

## Networking Protocol

### ESP-NOW Communication (Primary)
- **Message Types**: RAW data (0x00), Token broadcasts (0x01)
- **Chunked Transmission**: LED data split into 75-LED chunks for reliability
- **Token System**: MAC-based tokens for leader election and heartbeats
- **Robust Failover**: 3-strike timeout system with automatic re-election
- **Offline Priority**: Works perfectly without WiFi, mesh-first design

### WiFi Management (Secondary - OTA Only)
- **Multi-Network Support**: Tries multiple WiFi networks automatically
- **Non-Blocking**: WiFi operations never interfere with ESP-NOW mesh
- **Background Scanning**: WiFi checked every 2 minutes, status every 10 seconds
- **Clean Transitions**: Handles WiFi connect/disconnect gracefully
- **OTA Ready**: When WiFi available, enables over-the-air updates

### Network Resilience
- **Heartbeat Monitoring**: 1.5-second timeout detection
- **State Recovery**: Automatic LED blanking and state reset on leadership changes
- **Chunk Validation**: Complete frame assembly before display
- **Health Monitoring**: System checks prevent stuck states

## Usage Workflow

### Development
```bash
# Fast development iteration
./deploy_nodes.sh    # Choose option 4: Compile only
# â†’ Fast incremental build, version bump, ready for deployment

# When ready for OTA deployment
./deploy_nodes.sh    # Choose option 1: Deploy (or 3: Upload only)
# â†’ Uses cached build, deploys with retry logic to nodes.txt IPs

# For emergency/initial deployment via USB
./usb_simple.sh     # Interactive USB deployment
# â†’ Compile once, then upload to each node via USB cable
```

### Operation
1. **Power On**: Nodes connect to WiFi (if available) and enter AUTO mode at 25% brightness
2. **Auto-Sync**: Nodes elect leader and begin synchronized pattern display
3. **User Control**: Button A cycles brightness, Button B controls patterns (leader only) 
4. **Music Mode**: Leader's microphone drives synchronized audio reactivity across all nodes
5. **Offline Ready**: Full functionality without WiFi, mesh network self-manages

## System Requirements
- **Arduino IDE** with ESP32 support
- **M5StickC Plus2** board definitions
- **FastLED library** (3.10.1+)
- **M5Unified library** (0.2.7+)
- **ESP32 Arduino Core** (3.2.1+)

## Network Architecture
The system prioritizes ESP-NOW mesh networking for real-time LED synchronization, with WiFi as an optional secondary network for OTA updates and remote management. This ensures perfect performance whether in your shop with WiFi or out in the woods at Burning Man.

**Local mesh network handles**: Pattern synchronization, leader election, audio reactivity  
**WiFi network handles**: OTA updates, remote configuration, version management

This architecture provides the reliability of a local mesh with the convenience of WiFi connectivity when available.
